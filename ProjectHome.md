# Welcome to the BackMyFruitUp project #

Thank you all for your wonderful comments over the years. Like you, the Drobo team and I loved the DroboShare - and it was a great product in its time.

But DroboShare is gone -- not shipped for years now, superseded by the Drobo FS, which is a Drobo with -built-in- File Sharing. (I own one; it's super-cool, and has some nice Drobo Apps at http://www.Drobo.com/droboapps/)

So I'll be ending my support for BackMyFruitUp.

But don't despair! The gang at Drobo has kindly extended a rather large rebate to any DroboShare owner who wants to buy a new Drobo S or Drobo FS. (See below)

The Drobo S and Drobo FS are the successors to your tried and true Drobo/DroboShare combo. The S and FS are faster (4x or more!), quieter, have another drive slot (5 vs. 4) and are better equipped for future upgrades, including immediate support for drives larger than 2 TB.

Moreover, it's super-easy to move from your old Drobo to the new Drobo S. Use the Drobo Dashboard to gracefully shut down your Drobo, put the disks into the new Drobo S (don't add new disks during the transition, please), and boot up the new Drobo S. Drobo FS is slightly trickier - see the instructions at support.drobo.com - but still quick.

So don't hesitate - act now ;)
