= Introduction =

Apple makes it very difficult to use TimeMachine to backup to anything other than the expensive proprietary  TimeCapsule. This project enables one to use TimeMachine to backup to a Drobo/DroboShare over AFP via netatalk. This project is fully tested and stable. Multiple machines can be backed up to the same Drobo using different sparsebundles for each machine.

Note: I take no responsibility if this software destroys your applications or you lose all of your possessions.

= Installation =

#1. You must be using ext3 or HFS+ as your filesystem on your Drobo. I personally use HFS+. The reason is because NTFS and FAT32 do not support symbolic links properly. This will prevent BackMyFruitUp from working.

#2. Install the [http://drobo.com/droboapps/downloads/index.php?id=19 DroboApps Admin] package using the standard [http://drobo.com/droboapps/faq/index.html DroboApps installation instructions]. Once you have the admin package installed, make sure to also install Dropbear SSH.

#3. Open Terminal.app and log into your DroboShare via SSH. ssh root@[YOUR DROBO IP HERE]. ex: ssh root@192.168.1.32

_Note: the default root password is stored in the Important Information tab of the DroboAdmin website._

Confirm that the path to your DroboApps folder is this: {{{ /mnt/DroboShares/Drobo/DroboApps }}}. This is required for netatalk to install properly. The reason is because there is so many hard coded paths in the configuration files that it would be a real nightmare to try to make this any more dynamic than it is. If it is not this directory structure, you will need to use the beta release of [http://www.drobospace.com/group/23/Drobo-Dashboard-Public-Beta/ Drobo Dashboard] to rename your Drobo volume.

#3. Download and install the BackMyFruitUp 2.0 package from the Downloads tab above. Do not expand the enclosed netatalk.tgz file.

#4. Install netatalk.tgz by coping the file into your DroboApps folder. You will need to restart the DroboShare to get things running. It is easiest to do do a restart by using the DroboAdmin webpage.

Once the DroboShare is restarted, the netatalk.tgz file will convert into a netatalk folder. This should cause 'DroboCapsule' to appear in the Finder under the SHARED heading next to the DrobShare heading. It should have an icon like an XServe server.

= Details for TimeMachine Setup =

#1. From a Finder window click on the DroboCapsule in the Shared list and mount it as guest.  You should see two volumes, one titled Drobo and another titled DroboCapsule.  These are mount points via AFP. They differ from the mount via the Drobo Dashboard called Drobo, which uses SMB.  Load the DroboCapsule volume from the mount point. This is where you will put the sparsebundle that will be created in the next step.

#2. Run the Create Backup Volume application included in the BackMyFruitUp 2.0 download folder. It will ask you for the maximum size of the volume and will create a new sparsebundle on your desktop. This will take a few minutes to run. After it is finished, copy the sparsebundle to the DroboCapsule share and delete it from your desktop. Note: You will need to run this application on each Mac that you want to backup.

#3. Log out of the Finder and log back in.

#4. Open up TimeMachine in System Preferences, Change Disk to DroboCapsule. If you don't see DroboCapsule, then click on it in the Finder to mount it as a guest user. Now, start a backup. It should fail the first time. Eject the DroboCapsule share and start another backup again. This one should succeed. Remember, if you are on wireless, the first backup will take a long time. Sometimes it is better to just plug the machine in to a hub and back up the first time.

= Upgrade =

If you are upgrading from the previous version of BackMyFruitUp, all you need to do is first rename the existing netatalk folder to something else. Copy over the new netatalk.tgz and then restart your DroboShare using the DroboAdmin webpage. Please note that netatalk now runs as root by default. This will allow you to access all of your SMB files without problems. Once you have restarted, you can safely delete the older netatalk folder.

= Disable annoying message =

To turn off the annoying message, all you need to do is rename the MESSAGE.txt file to anything else.
