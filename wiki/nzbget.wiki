I'm going to try something a little different. Times are tough and my time is valuable. In order to compensate me for my time working on porting nzbget to the DroboShare, please donate $25 to my paypal account. Once the donation is received, I will immediately email you a copy of the binary which is all setup to run on your DroboShare.

Click the button below (note: a paypal account is not required to donate):
