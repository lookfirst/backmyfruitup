= Welcome to the BackMyFruitUp project =

<img src="http://backmyfruitup.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/fruit_sm.jpg" />

BackMyFruitUp adds netatalk (AFP) functionality to a DroboShare. In turn it also adds support for TimeMachine backups to a Drobo via a DroboShare. Effectively it allows for a TimeCapsule-like backup system to a NAS drive. This project is fully tested and stable.

*Many people have reported faster transfer speeds using this product than with the built in SMB sharing on the DroboShare. This has been more than worth installing for some people just because of this.*

Start with the SetupGuideVersion3.

*Please note: The current version does not work with the recently released 10.7 Lion. I'm working on it.*
